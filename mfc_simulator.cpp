    /*
        There will be a loop that will check the clock_time per iteration
        For each iteration, the system will add new threads to their respective queues
        if their arrival time matches clock_time (USE add_to_queue METHOD!)

        The first process in the current priority queue will run until one of three things occur,
            1. It finishes execution
            2. The time slice expires
            3. A higher priority queue is no longer empty

        If 1 occurs, delete the thread pointer, and start running a new thread
        If 2 occurs, add the current running thread to the back of its assigned queue, reset the time slice, and run a new thread
        If 3 occurs, immediately move the current running thread to the back of its queue, reset the time slice, change the currentPriority,
            and run a new thread

        Once a thread begins running, immediately check to see if it needs a resource (-1 means it doesn't need a resource)
        If a resource is needed, use the thread's needed_resource attribute as the index to "resources" array defined earlier.
        If the resource at the index is FALSE, set it to TRUE, and set the thread's has_resource attribute to TRUE.
        If the resource is already TRUE, and the Thread's has_resource is FALSE, the thread becomes blocked 
            => push it to the blocked queue
        If the resource is already TRUE, and the Thread's has_resource is TRUE, the thread was the one who acquired the resource, 
            continue running as normal

        There will be a function defined SIGNAL which will loop through the block queue and check if the blocked threads' needed_resource
            have been changed to FALSE
        If so, move the blocked thread back to its priority queue.

        The attributes of the threads are public and can be changed directly. Use burst_time as a counter for remaining time the thread has to execute.

        The condition to end the main loop I still need to work out. We can stop when all threads have completed, so when the store_arr is full of 
            nullptrs?
